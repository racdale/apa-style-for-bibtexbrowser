apa-style-for-bibtexbrowser
=========================

Note: Ongoing development for personal use; check back for updates.


apa-style-for-bibtexbrowser is a custom style script for [bibtexbrowser][1],
a PHP-based generator for citations from bibtex files. It uses standard APA format,
and also orders both by year and author names. Currently, only chapters, conference
proceedings, and journal articles are supported. Other publication categories added
soon.

cv.php shows an example, using the *.bib files in the repository. The 
bibtexbrowser.apa.php is a modified bibtexbrowser which orders by author, makes some
changes to author/editor array implosion to abide by APA format, among a few other
adjustments.

I hope it's useful to others.
